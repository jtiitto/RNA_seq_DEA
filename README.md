# RNA-seq_Differential Gene Expression Analysis
RNA-seq allows us to monitor gene-expression on different levels. Data found on this page was used on course FOR-271 "Practical course in Bioinformatics" at University of Helsinki
Steps taken to represent the data were:
- Count normalization
- Principal Component Analysis & Hierarchical Clustering
- Gene differential expression analysis with edgeR
